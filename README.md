# Early stage diabetes risk prediction  
  
## Overview  
The dataset contains the sign and symptom data of newly diabetic or would be diabetic patient. The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient is diabetic by using the signs and symptoms. The dataset was obtained from UCI - Machine Learning Repository and can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset. .  
  
## Machine Learning Algorithms used  
In this project 4 algorithms are used to predict the target variable.
1. Logistic Regression
2. K - Nearest Neighbors
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Random Forest
  
All these algorithms have been implemented with grid search and 7-fold cross-validation.  
  
The comparison of all the results is also provided in the ipython notebook.
